============

We are happy to accept your pull requests. If you do, make sure you clearly explain what and why you changed/added something so we can easily review it.

* Sadly enough we have no tests yet, but they will be coming soon.
* Make sure your code is linted and follow the general code style:
  * "" for strings
  * 2 whitespace indentation
  * named functions as much as possible
  * semi-colons!
  * name your captured this "self"
